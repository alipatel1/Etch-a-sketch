Notes:

To have number of boxes be dependent on input: Would I be able to make a function that calculates the box size based on total size of the container then divide that by the number of boxes?


  <div id="mainbox">
        <div class="buttons">
            <button class="reset">Reset</button>
            <button class="squareNum">Number of Squres</button>
        </div>
      <div id="container"></div>
    </div>
